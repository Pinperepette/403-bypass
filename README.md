# Bypass Tester Script

This Python script is designed to conduct bypass tests on a web application, probing for security vulnerabilities through URL manipulations and custom HTTP headers. The aim is to discover potential ways to access resources or execute actions within the application without proper authorization.

## How to Use the Script

1.  **Installation:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    
2.  **Execution:** Run the script from the command line by providing two arguments:
    
    bash
    

1.  `python script.py [Base_URL] [Specific_Path]` 
    
    -   `[Base_URL]`: The base URL of the web application to be tested.
    -   `[Specific_Path]`: The specific path of the application to be checked for vulnerabilities.

## Techniques Used

The script employs various bypass techniques, such as URL manipulations and sending special HTTP requests with custom headers, to identify potential vulnerabilities. It displays the results of the requests made, including HTTP statuses and content lengths.

## Disclaimer

Using this script on systems without the owner's permission is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have the owner's consent before conducting tests on any system.

_Note: This readme provides only a general overview of the script. Make sure to fully understand the code before using it._
